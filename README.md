# Ultrawave Chess Example

This is a multiplayer chess game using [ultrawave](//github.com/charlieschwabcher/ultrawave)
to sync game state over WebRTC data channels.

To run locally, `npm install` and `npm start`, then visit [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) in a few tabs and try making some moves.

The source is es6 and css4 - after editing, `npm run build` to compile w/ babel and cssnext.
